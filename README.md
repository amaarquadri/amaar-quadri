# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm experienced with mechanical design, design for manufacturing, and project management. I also have extensive programming experience in C++, Python, and MATLAB. I have a passion for using all of my skills for designing robotic systems from the ground up! I'm currently looking for a summer 2024 internship.
